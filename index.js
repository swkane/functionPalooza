// IMPORTANT: This entire exercise is unique in that it is meant to be done without googling or looking at other code of any kind. It is just your Javascript skills and interpreting the errors you receive.

// README: To work through this, start by solving the first ReferenceError and then write the body of the function that will meet the requirement in the revealed statement.

// 1. Create a function that will add 2 numbers together:




console.log('Correct Answer: 5 ', 'Your answer: ', add(2, 3));

// 2. Create a function that will take 2 arguments and return their product





console.log('Correct Answer: 6 ', 'Your answer: ',  mult(2, 3));

// 3. Create a function that will take 2 arguments and return their product, using only the "+" operator and a for loop






console.log('Correct Answer: 6 ', 'Your answer: ', multWithPlus(2, 3));

// 4. Create a function that will take 2 arguments and return their product, without using any operators, but instead using a for loop to call your add function many times









console.log('Correct Answer: 6 ', 'Your answer: ', multWithAddFunc(2, 3));

// 5. Write a function named "power" that takes two arguments (x and n) and returns the the result of raising x to the nth power.







console.log('Correct Answer: 8 ', 'Your answer: ', power(2, 3));


// BONUS 6. Write a function named "powerWithFunc" that takes two arguments (x and n) and returns the the result of raising x to the nth power, without using any operators, but using functions previously written in this exercise








console.log('This should equal 8: ', 'Your answer: ', powerWithFunc(2, 3));
